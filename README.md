# Frontend: React Concepts

Example GitHub Repository frontend to test the Repository API, the backend project we have developed earlier.

## Usage

After cloning the repo, you should run this command in order to have everything initialized for development:

````
yarn
````

Next, start the application with:

````
yarn start
````

Or run its tests:

````
yarn test
````

You can also build it for production:

````
yarn build
````

That's it!
